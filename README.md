### **Features**
- **Risk Assessment**: Predicts diabetes risk levels (Normal, Warning, Critical) using XGBoost.
- **Glucose Prediction**: Forecasts glucose trends using LSTM based on historical readings.
- **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Lifestyle advice tailored to BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure.
  - Dietary changes based on glycemic control needs.
  - Preventive measures for long-term health management.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for seamless user experience.
- **Google Gemini API Integration**: AI-driven insights supplement manual recommendations.

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/its308/HealthSphere.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HealthSphere
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### **Usage**
1. Run the Streamlit app locally:
   ```bash
   streamlit run scripts/app.py
   ```
2. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Input your health metrics (e.g., BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure) and historical glucose readings to get:
   - Risk assessment
   - Predicted glucose trends
   - Personalized recommendations

1. Integrate wearable device APIs (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health) for real-time data.
2. Add visualizations for glucose trends and risk progression.
3. Expand recommendations to include mental health assessments (e.g., PHQ-9/GAD-7).
4. Deploy on scalable platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.
